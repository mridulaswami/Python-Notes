#python

1. identation is necessary.
2. string is reperesented as str
3. semi-colon is optional , if-else statement is closed by :
4. variable names are case-sensitive
5. we can easily assign single value to multiple variables 
    like x = y = z = "Orange"
    x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
6. we can print multiple strings or integer in print statement    
   like x= "my"
   y="name is"
   z="mridula"
   print(x,y,z) or print(x+y+z) = my name is mridula
7. similarly "+" operator between integer will act as mathematical operator
   print (5 +10) = 15
8. but if we combine string and integer both then "+" will give error but "," will work
   like 
   print (5 + "john")= error
   print (5 , "john")= 5 john   
9. function is written as def()
10. global() is a keyword defined for global scope
11. dataypes to store multiple values-
    list = ["apple","cheery","mango"]
    tuple = ("apple","cherry","mango")
    set = {"apple","cheery","mango"}
    dict ={"name":"john","age":36}// basically a hashmap ( key-value pair)
12. bool = boolean data type
13. to find out length - len()  


##Python-Lists

1. use [] - square brackets.
2. lists are orderable, changeable and can allow duplicates
3. we cannot delete elements from lists.
4. negative indexing is used in lists. 
like thislist = ["apple","mango","cherry"]
print(thislist[-1]) ==> it will give you cherry 

5. we can also specify the range of elements while accessing the lists.
like thislist = ["apple","mango","cherry","kiwi","banana","melon"]
print(thislist[2:5]) ==> ["cherry","kiwi","banana"]
remember that 5th element isn't included in this range , take it as (5-2=3 elements)

6. we can also give just one element in range like-
thislist[2:] ==> it will give elements from 2nd index to end --> ["cherry","kiwi","banana","melon"]
thislist[:2]==> it will just give elements from 0th index to 2nd --> ["apple","mango"]

7. we can also check if an element is present in a list 
if "apple" in thislist:
  print("yes presnt") 

--> it will "yes present"

8. with same range function , we can also change/alter lists elements 
9. to add elements in list-
   a. use append like - thislist.append("pomegrante") -- > it will add it at last
   b. use insert for particular index insert like - thislist.insert(2, "grapes") --> it will add grapes to 2nd index
      and will shift others to one more indexes 
      ex- ["apple","mango","grapes","cherry","kiwi","banana","melon"]

10. to add another list in existing list-
    we will use extend keyword
    thislist=["mango","kiwi"]
    tropical = ["grapes","pomegranate"]
    thislist.extends(tropical) 
    it will give thislist with added elements of tropical at the end .
this particular method is not only just for adding lists to lists , we can add tuple ,sets, dict anything to lists with extends.

11. to remove elements from lists- 
    a. remove keyword - thislist.remove("cherry") -- removes the elements
    b . pop - thislist.pop(1) -- removes the indexed elements
        and pop() - will delete the last element
    c . del - del thislist[0]- deletes the indexed element
         del thislist[] - will delete the entrie list
    d. clear - thislist.clear()  -- > will clear the entire list and give -> []
