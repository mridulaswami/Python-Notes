#python

1. identation is necessary.
2. string is reperesented as str
3. semi-colon is optional , if-else statement is closed by :
4. variable names are case-sensitive
5. we can easily assign single value to multiple variables 
    like x = y = z = "Orange"
    x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
6. we can print multiple strings or integer in print statement    
   like x= "my"
   y="name is"
   z="mridula"
   print(x,y,z) or print(x+y+z) = my name is mridula
7. similarly "+" operator between integer will act as mathematical operator
   print (5 +10) = 15
8. but if we combine string and integer both then "+" will give error but "," will work
   like 
   print (5 + "john")= error
   print (5 , "john")= 5 john   
9. function is written as def()
10. global() is a keyword defined for global scope
11. dataypes to store multiple values-
    list = ["apple","cheery","mango"]
    tuple = ("apple","cherry","mango")
    set = {"apple","cheery","mango"}
    dict ={"name":"john","age":36}// basically a hashmap ( key-value pair)
12. bool = boolean data type
13. to find out length - len()
