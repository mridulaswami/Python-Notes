# python-tuples 

1. they are ordered, allow duplicates but are unchangeable (means we cannot add or remove items once created in tuple)
2. they are enclosed in round brackets. ()
3. for creating them , we must give , in statement so that compiler can know that it is a tuple and not a string
    eg- thistuple= ("apple",) - tuple
        thistuple= ("apple")- string

4. for finding length , we use len() method ( same as lists) 
5. they can contain any datatype items together -
   thistuple = ("Apple",2,3.0)

6 . we can create tuple using tuple() constructor
   thistuple = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))

7. access of tuples is same as lists.

8. Manipulating Tuples-

  a. we cannot update tuples like lists because they are immutable, but we can add elements by-
  b. converting tuples to list and then adding them and then again changing it to tuples.
   eg- x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
        y = list(x)
        y[1] = "kiwi"
        x = tuple(y)
        
        print(x)
     o/p= ("apple","kiwi","cherry") 

   c. or using append on list and then changing it to tuples.
   d. or add tuples to tuples. 
    thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
    y = ("orange",)
    thistuple += y
    
    print(thistuple)
   o/p= ("apple", "banana", "cherry","orange")

  💡💡 - basically do the lists changes by converting tuples to lists and then again to tuples.

e. delete the whole tuple using del keyword
    eg- thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
        del thistuple

9. loops is same as lists.
10. we can multiply tuple using * 
   eg- fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
        mytuple = fruits * 2
        
        print(mytuple)
    o/p= ("apple", "banana", "cherry","apple", "banana", "cherry")




####### tuple methods - 

a. count() - gives the exact count of an element present in tuple 
thistuple = (1, 3, 7, 8, 7, 5, 4, 6, 8, 5)

x = thistuple.count(5)

print(x)
o/p= 2

b . index()- gives the first index of the element. 

thistuple = (1, 3, 7, 8, 7, 5, 4, 6, 8, 5)

x = thistuple.index(8)

print(x)

o/p= 3 ( 8 is coming 2 times but it will give the index of first occurence of 8 i.e. index 3)
