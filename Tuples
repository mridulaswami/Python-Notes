# python-tuples 

1. they are ordered, allow duplicates but are unchangeable (means we cannot add or remove items once created in tuple)
2. they are enclosed in round brackets. ()
3. for creating them , we must give , in statement so that compiler can know that it is a tuple and not a string
    eg- thistuple= ("apple",) - tuple
        thistuple= ("apple")- string

4. for finding length , we use len() method ( same as lists) 
5. they can contain any datatype items together -
   thistuple = ("Apple",2,3.0)

6 . we can create tuple using tuple() constructor
   thistuple = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))
