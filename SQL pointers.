1. reading and deleting from same query doesn't work in Mysql but runs in MS SQL SERVER.

delete from Person where not id in 
(select min(id) from Person group by email)

it will run in sql server but in mysql

2. we can use order by on count and limit for getting highest count value.

eg- select customer_name from Orders group by customer_number
order by count(order_number) desc limit 1

it will give customer_name who has highest orders.

3. usage of datediff() where we have to compare current date from previous dates for some condition.

eg- select a.id from Weather a join Weather b on datediff(a.recordDate,b.recordDate)=1
where a.temperature>b.temperature

here I have compared today with yesterday and provided the data if today's temperature is higher than yesterday's.

4. usage of IF keyword in MYSQL (more efficient)(but only for MYSQL)
 if we want to check multiple conditions in an statement then it is better to use IF instead of CASE keyword -

eg- select x,y,z,
if(x+y > z and
  x+z >y and
  y+z >x , 'Yes', 'No') 
  as triangle
 from Triangle 

here I had to find out if x,y,z can form a traingle or not , so using a case keyword may be hectic here like- 

select x,y,z,
case when x+y > z and
  x+z >y and
  y+z >x then 'Yes' else 'No'
  end as triangle
 from Triangle
