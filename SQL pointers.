1. reading and deleting from same query doesn't work in Mysql but runs in MS SQL SERVER.

delete from Person where not id in 
(select min(id) from Person group by email)

it will run in sql server but in mysql

2. we can use order by on count and limit for getting highest count value.

eg- select customer_name from Orders group by customer_number
order by count(order_number) desc limit 1

it will give customer_name who has highest orders.
