1. identation is always necessary in if-else statement.
2. always use colon (:) 
3. can have multiple print statement
4. we can use boolean variables directly for conditioning
eg- 
if 30>20:
    print("yes")
    print("it is correct)
eg- 
login_in= "True"
if login_in:
    print("correct")

💡💡 - python is opposite than C , here - ZERO(0), empty strings ("") and empty collections are treated as false and everything 
else is treated as true , like 5, -6 and even false string is treated as True

if "False":
  print("Welcome back!")
else:
  print("no") 


if 5:
  print("Welcome back!")
else:
  print("no")  

if -8:
  print("Welcome back!")
else:
  print("no")  

all o/p= Welcome back!

5. python ELIF works on the idea of - as soon as conditions matches 
it will check the multiple conditions and execute the exact match.

age = 10

if age < 13:
  print("You are a child")
elif age < 20:
  print("You are a teenager")
elif age < 65:
  print("You are an adult")
elif age >= 65:
  print("You are a senior")

o/p= You are a child

6. shorthand if -
we can also use one-liner if statement
eg- 
x=14, y=12
max = x if x>y else y

syntax-
variable = value_if_true if condition else value_if_false

7. if we don't want to put any execution for particular condition , we can use PASS with IF ( means no actio needed)
age= 16
if age<18:
    PASS
else:
    print("acess granted")
