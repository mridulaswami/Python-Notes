1. items of sets are unordered, unindexed and doesn't allow duplicates.
2. we cannot change the items of sets but we can add / remove them.
3. we use paranthesis to represent set
4. we can create it using set() constructor as well
thisset = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) 

5. we cannot access the items using indexing , rather we can access them using for loop
thisset={"apple","cherry","mango"}
for x in thisset:
   print(x)

6. we can also get boolean values for if in sets.
print("banana" in thisset)
o/p= false

or 

if "banana" in thisset:
    print("true")

7. adding new items in sets / adding new set into set.
 a. using add() method 
    eg- thisset.add("orange")
 b.  using update() method- by this we can add new set or any other data structure like list, tuple in set
     eg- thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
        tropical = {"pineapple", "mango", "papaya"}
        
        thisset.update(tropical)
        
        print(thisset)

     o/p= {'apple', 'mango', 'cherry', 'pineapple', 'banana', 'papaya'}  (( un-ordered , hence we can set in any order ))

   💡💡 - add any iterable

      thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
      mylist = ["kiwi", "orange"]
      
      thisset.update(mylist)
      
      print(thisset)

   o/p= {"apple","orange","cherry","kiwi","banana"}


8. removing items ( thislist = thisset) ( used by mistake)
 a. using remove 
    thislist.remove("banana")  - if banana not present then it will give error
 b. using discard
    thislist.discard("banana")  - if banana not present then it will not give error.
 c. using pop
    thislist.pop() - this is ambigous because set is unordered, unindexed , so it can remove any element of any index- not preferable
 d. using clear()- will clear the set
    thislist.clear()
 e. using del() - delete the whole set
    del thislist

9. operations on sets- 

   a. union- joining two sets into a new set, we can use OR (|) or that as well 
     note that | operator only allows between sets and not any other iterables but  union keyword does.
      eg- fruits={"apple","banana"}
           vege = {"potato","tomato"}
          eatables= fruits.union(vege)
          eatables= fruits | vege
      o/p= {"potato","apple","banana","tomato"}
     union can be used to join all iterables like sets with lists , tuples etc.
     ## if we want to update the existing set only , we use update instead of union
     e.g- vege.update(fruits)
   
     note- that union and update will not include duplicate entries.

  b. intersection- gives items that are present in both of the sets. , we can use AND (&) 
     note that & operator only allows between sets and not any other iterables but  intersection keyword does.
      set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
      set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}
      
      set3 = set1.intersection(set2)
      print(set3)
      o/p= {"apple"}
      ## if we want to update the existing set only , we use intersection_update instead of intersection.
      e.g- set1.intersection_update(set2)

  c. difference- gives elements that are not present in other set , we can use SUBTRACT(-)
     note that - operator only allows between sets and not any other iterables but  difference keyword does.
     eg- 
      set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
      set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}
      
      set3 = set1.difference(set2)
      
      print(set3)
      o/p= {"banana","cherry"}
      ## if we want to update the existing set only , we use difference_update instead of difference.
      eg- set1.difference_update(set2)

  d. symmetric_difference- gives all other items except intersection(same elements), we can use (^) operator
     note that ^ operator only allows between sets and not any other iterables but  symmetric_difference keyword does.
     eg- 
      set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
      set2 = {"google", "microsoft", "apple"}
      
      set3 = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)
      
      print(set3)
      o/p= {"banana","cherry","google","microsoft"}
      ## if we want to update the existing set only , we use symmetric_difference_update instead of difference.
      eg- set1.symmetric_difference_update(set2)
