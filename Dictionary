1. basically a key-value pair ( usually known as hashmap in java)
2. they are ordered, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
3. Accessing dicts- 
   a. eg - 
        thisdict = {
        "brand": "Ford",
        "model": "Mustang",
        "year": 1964
      }
      print(thisdict["brand"])
      or we can also use get() method 
      x= thisdict.get("model")

   b. we can also find out only keys present in dict using
      thisdict.keys()
      and values using thisdict.values()
   c. and to get all items , we use thisdict.items()- it will give all keys and values as tuples 

4. changing values- 
  a. updating directly-
     thisdict["model"]="Volvo" ## this will update model to volvo
  b. using update() keyword - 
     thisdict.update({"model":"VOLVO"})
  we can use the same methods to add new items in a dict as well

5. Removing items -
   a. pop()
      thisdict.pop("model")
   b. popitem() - will remove last inserted entry
      thisdict.popitem()
   c. del()
      del thisdict["model"]
      it can also delete the whole dict - del thisdict
   d. clear() - will clear the dict
      thisdict.clear()

6. Loops usgae in dict-
   a. using normal for loop for keys-
      for x in thisdict:
          print(x)   
      for x in thisdict.keys():
          print(x)
   b. using for loop for values- 
      for x in thisdict:
          print(thisdict[x]) 
      for x in thisdict.keys():
          print(x)
   c. using for loop for both of the items
      for x,y in thisdict.items():
          print(x,y)

7. copying the dicts-
   we cannot directly copy the dicts using dict1= dict2 , because it will create reference to each other and changes made to one will be reflected in other as well.
   so , we will use either copy() keyword or dict() constructor
    mydict= thisdict.copy()
    mydict = dict(thisdict)

8. nested lists- 

   child1= {"name":"mridula","age":24}
   child2= {"name":"shrey","age":21}
   child3= {"name":"utkarsh","age":25}

   myfamily = {child1,child2,child3}

  print(myfamily["child2"]["name"])

💡💡 - think about this nested loop and understand. 

    for x, obj in myfamily.items():
        print(x)
      
        for y in obj:
          print(y + ':', obj[y])
