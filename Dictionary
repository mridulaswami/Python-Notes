1. basically a key-value pair ( usually known as hashmap in java)
2. they are ordered, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
3. Accessing dicts- 
   a. eg - 
        thisdict = {
        "brand": "Ford",
        "model": "Mustang",
        "year": 1964
      }
      print(thisdict["brand"])
      or we can also use get() method 
      x= thisdict.get("model")

   b. we can also find out only keys present in dict using
      thisdict.keys()
      and values using thisdict.values()
   c. and to get all items , we use thisdict.items()- it will give all keys and values as tuples 

4. changing values- 
  a. updating directly-
     thisdict["model"]="Volvo" ## this will update model to volvo
  b. using update() keyword - 
     thisdict.update({"model":"VOLVO"})
  we can use the same methods to add new items in a dict as well

5. Removing items -
   a. pop()
      thisdict.pop("model")
   b. popitem() - will remove last inserted entry
      thisdict.popitem()
   c. del()
      del thisdict["model"]
      it can also delete the whole dict - del thisdict
   d. clear() - will clear the dict
      thisdict.clear()
